    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
        These carrot apple pancakes, inspired by a carrot apple salad, are more like carrot cake meets apple fritter meets pancakes. If you'd like a perfect bite of a perfect pancake, here it is.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup grated carrot</li>
        <li>5 tablespoons unsalted butter, divided</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon grated ginger root</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon ground cinnamon</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1/2 lemon, juiced</li>
        <li>1 apple, unpeeled</li>
        <li>1/3 cup chopped walnuts (optional)</li>
        <li>1/2 cup self-rising flour</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Peel and grate enough carrot to fill a 1-cup measuring cup, unpacked. Melt 3 tablespoons butter in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add grated carrots and salt, and cook, stirring, until carrot begins to lose its raw character and softens only slightly, about 2 minutes.</li>

        <li>Transfer carrots into a bowl, and add ginger, cinnamon, white sugar, egg, and lemon juice.  Stir well to combine. Grate apple into the bowl, and stir to combine.</li>

        <li>Add self-rising flour, and stir until it disappears. Let batter rest about 5 minutes. Meanwhile, melt remaining 2 tablespoons butter in the same skillet used for carrots over medium heat.</li>

        <li>Once the butter melts, transfer in about 1/4 cup batter per pancake, and flatten slightly with the back of the spoon. Cook pancakes until browned and cooked through, about 3 minutes per side.</li>

        <li>Serve topped with an optional spoon of yogurt, maple syrup, and chopped walnuts if desired.</li>
    </ol>
